# Program Assignment 9

Written by Anthony Wang and Natalie Lee

## Project Overview

This project involves debugging and improving a simple implementation of algebraic operations on polynomials in Java. The focus is on identifying and fixing issues within the `BuggyPolynomial` class, which is intended to support generic arithmetic operations (addition and multiplication) on polynomials over a ring. The core concept is to implement basic polynomial algebra while adhering to generic programming principles.

### Debugging Process
1. Read through the codes for any obvious mistakes
2. Make sure that comments and the code are aligned
3. Run the tests to see what's wrong with the code and fix them
4. Enhance commenting for readability
5. Added more edge-case testing
