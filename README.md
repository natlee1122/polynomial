# Program Assignment 9

Written by Anthony Wang and Natalie Lee

## Project Overview

This project involves debugging and improving a simple implementation of algebraic operations on polynomials in Java. The focus is on identifying and fixing issues within the `BuggyPolynomial` class, which is intended to support generic arithmetic operations (addition and multiplication) on polynomials over a ring. The core concept is to implement basic polynomial algebra while adhering to generic programming principles.

### Debugging Process
1. Make sure that comments and the code are aligned
2.
